        Version one. April 19, 2023. Brooklyn. What is this? It's my personal
        website. I'm super excited about this project because it's a combination
        of so many things I want to focus on. Web development, design, writing,
        a creative outlet. A place to talk about ideas close to my heart and
        also showcase my dev skills to the world. I'm starting off my building
        this from scratch with the simplest tools possible. HTML. I'm literally
        just writing this post directly into vs code and I threw it into an
        article element so that should cover semantic HTML right? So much to
        learn and do. Let's get started. I will be documenting the process of
        building this as I go. Okay bye guys I need to figure out how to deploy
        this.
